# Common Extension Methods

This is a stand-alone project that consists in a collection of extension methods. I usually carry them over to every other project I work on, so I figured: why not make it a public package?

It's not much, but I hope you find it useful. 

# QA 
I use SonarQube to check quality, but I cannot make the project public. (I'm working on that.) However, this project as 100% of unit test coverage and zero bugs, code smells, or vulnerabilities.

# Documentation
The documentation is autogenerated. I'm not happy with it, but it's a start.

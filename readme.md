# Common Extension Methods

This is a stand-alone project that consists in a collection of extension methods. I usually carry them over to every other project I work on, so I figured: why not make it a public package?

It's not much, but I hope you find it useful. 

# Documentation
Autogenerated documentation.
[Docs/Raccoon.Ninja.Extensions.Common.md](./Docs/Raccoon.Ninja.Extensions.Common.md)


# Local build
To build this package locally, you must have the doc generator installed:
```shell
dotnet tool install xmldocmd -g
```

The documentation will be (re-)generated automatically after every Release build.
